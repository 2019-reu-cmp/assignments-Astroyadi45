>1:
    The smaller the tolerance, the more iterations it will have to go through.
    10e-3: 7 iterations
    10e-6: 17 iters.
    10e-9: 27 iters.
>2:
    You can make bysection.py a function itself. So that you can call it from other programs.
    Then you would pass tolerance and the function as inputs.
>3:
    Tuples are immutabale and cant have repeated elements.
    Lists can be altered or appended.
    Dictionaries are set up in pairs (keys and corresponding values), they are mutable.
    Sets are not set up in pairs, and they contain distinct objects.
>4:
    You can do something like:
        a=[0,1,'w']
        if type(a) is list:
            print("yes, a list")
